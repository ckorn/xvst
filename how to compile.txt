How to compile xVideoServiceThief?
----------------------------------

A compiler directrive (STATIC_BUILD) must be defined if you want to get a "valid" xVST compilation.

- Static mode:

	If you want compile the xVST in STATIC version, you should do:
		> qmake -set build_mode static_build
		> qmake
		> make


- Dynamic mode:

	If you want compile the xVST in DYNAMIC version, you should do:
		> qmake -set build_mode dynamic_build
		> qmake
		> make

- Frameworks mode (only MacOSX):

	If you want compile the xVST in FRAMEWORKS version, you should do:
		> qmake -set build_mode frameworks_build
		> qmake
		> make

If you are using Windows, you can use the automated scripts for compile the xVST.
